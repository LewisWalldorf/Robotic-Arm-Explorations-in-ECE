# Robotic-Arm-Explorations-in-ECE
The process behind creating our robot arm was arduous at first but as I became more familiar with Thonny and the interface with the pi pico board I became so much more capable and confident in my programming ability. After struggling through its initial phases our project really took off and miraculously came together in the final week.

We devided our team into groups designated to coding, printing, and construction of the robotic arm. The print came down to the last day because of the backlog of prints submitted the final week. Our servos were connected and the code was working just as intended. The satisfaction of watching our robot jolt to life made the entire process worth it.

Brainstorming for the project was really simple and easy, although we definitely had issues looking for the proper code to use for our project. These projects helped me learn how to collaborate with others in an engineering setting as well as knowing how to properly communicate in my craft.

I really am taking a lot of value from this class and feel that Iâ€™m taking my first steps of becoming an engineer. I really enjoyed and valued putting together the robot. I also really appreciated the soldering knowledge I gained from the lab. This project really helped us understand the basics of what an engineer's job is going to look like.
